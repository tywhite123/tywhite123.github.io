## Intro
This module involved creating a Game Engine for the first peice of coursework and then using that engine to create a game. The engine had to have multiple subsystems like Graphics, Physics, Input, FileIO, etc. It also needed to use middleware for some of the subsystems that we would then work with to create a layer between that and the game. Another thing that the engine had to do would be to generate the levels using data input from a file or procedural generation.

## Middleware Used:
Middleware/Libraries used to build the game engine:
* Box2D: This was used as the physics engine. As it is a 2D game I was making, I used a 2D physics engine.
* NCLGL: This was used to as the graphics engine for the project. This is a library built using openGL and is Newcastle University's own graphics framework.
* XInput: Allowed for the use of adding XBox 360 controller support into the engine.
* FMOD: This was the audio library I used for adding and playing audio effects in game.
* GLText: This was the text library that I used for displaying text in an OpenGL window.
