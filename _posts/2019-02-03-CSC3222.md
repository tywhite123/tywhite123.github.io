## Game Simulations
This was similar to the Game Tech coursework in which we had to make a physics engine and add some AI agents into a project. In this coursework we had to implement a 2D physics engine that would allow a player to move the leader raider, the other raiders needed to follow the player and there was a dragon as the enemy of the player and their gang of raiders. The physics engine was pretty basic in this coursework and was passed into the graphics subsystem rather than being a seperate subsystem.
