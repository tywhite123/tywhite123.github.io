## Pong
This college project was one of my first game programming projects, the brief/spec for this project was to recreate a retro game for one of our first programming projects. For this I decided to recreate pong as it allowed me to do two player controls and have a variable ball speed. This was a pretty basic recreation but I was using windows forms with VB.NET to make the game so there wasn't as much to be done. It was still an enjoyable project overall as it allowed me to make a game.

This wasn't the only time I recreated Pong in a programming language, as I did recreate it once with Java and LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library) as a way to learn what I could do with programming when I was teaching myself programming and Java when I was back in Year 10 of school.
